# kubernetes-practice

Hi, I’m Nkechi Ahanonye 👋  
This repo is my learning ground for Kubernetes — where I practice deploying containerized apps using YAML configurations.

---

## 📁 What’s Inside

A collection of basic YAML files to help me understand:

- ✅ Pod creation (`pod.yaml`)
- ✅ Deployments and ReplicaSets (`deployment.yaml`)
- ✅ Services for exposing apps (`service.yaml`)
- ✅ ConfigMaps and Secrets

---

## ▶️ How to Use

Make sure you have `kubectl` and a Kubernetes cluster running (like Minikube or Docker Desktop). Then apply the files:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

To delete resources:

```bash
kubectl delete -f pod.yaml
```

You can modify and reapply files as you learn more.

## 🎯 What I’m Practicing

- Writing clean, working YAML files
- Understanding how Kubernetes objects relate (Pods, Deployments, Services)
- Learning how to manage apps in a real Kubernetes environment
